## Introduction

Welcome to the **Word Cloud Service (WCS)** project! This service allows users to generate visually appealing word clouds from text data. Word clouds are a popular way to visualize the frequency of words in a given text, making it easier to identify key themes and concepts. This project was developed during a hackathon and aims to provide a user-friendly interface and robust backend for word cloud generation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Word Cloud Generation**: Create word clouds in real-time from user-provided text.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Users can customize colors, fonts, and shapes of the word clouds.
- **Downloadable Outputs**: Save generated word clouds in various formats (PNG, JPEG, SVG).
- **API Access**: Integrate WCS into other applications via a RESTful API.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Generate word clouds from text in multiple languages.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user accounts and save generated word clouds for future access.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js
  - D3.js (for rendering word clouds)
  - Bootstrap (for responsive design)

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (for data storage)

- **Deployment**: 
  - Docker
  - Heroku / AWS (for cloud hosting)

## Installation

To set up the Word Cloud Service locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wcs.git
   cd wcs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     ```
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm start
     ```
   - Start the frontend application:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Creating a Word Cloud**:
   - Navigate to the "Create" page.
   - Input your text in the provided text area.
   - Customize the appearance using the options available.
   - Click on "Generate Word Cloud" to see the result.

2. **Saving and Downloading**:
   - After generating a word cloud, you can save it to your account or download it directly.

3. **API Usage**:
   - To generate a word cloud via the API, send a POST request to `/api/wordcloud` with the text data in the body.

   Example:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/wordcloud -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "your text here"}'
   ```
